  |   Richard Nolan is one of the few journalists openly criticizing this   |
  |   development. When he wakes up in hospital after an explosion and      |
  |   finds that his wife and son have mysteriously vanished, Richard       |
  |   realizes: he and his family have become more than just bystanders     |

  |   between dystopian reality and digital utopia. Instead, they find      |

  |   humanity: Could a perfect digital utopia be the answer? A virtual     |
  |   paradise not affected by material needs and quarrels? Could a         |
  |   super-AI be our savior - or would it simply declare us as             |
  |   dispensable since it could not be taught the value of philanthropy?   |
